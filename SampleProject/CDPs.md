I made this map of [Census-designated places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census-designated_place) and municipalities in the DC area for [a Greater Greater Washington article](https://ggwash.org/view/63487/where-you-live-is-important-but-around-here-its-not-that-easy-to-define).  My data source was US Census shapefiles for places used in the 2010 Census.  The map was made in QGIS.
