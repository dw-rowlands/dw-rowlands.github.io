I made this map of [Census-designated places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census-designated_place) and municipalities in the DC area for [a Greater Greater Washington article](https://ggwash.org/view/63487/where-you-live-is-important-but-around-here-its-not-that-easy-to-define) in June 2017.  

Incorporated places (including both towns and independent cities in Virginia and cities, towns, and the City of Baltimore in Maryland) are colored orange and Census-designated places are colored yellow.  My data source was US Census shapefiles for places used in the 2010 Census.  The map was made in QGIS 2.
