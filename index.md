My name is DW Rowlands.  I am a visiting lecturer in chemistry at the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://www.umbc.edu) and I write about urban planning, transportation, and local history topics for [Greater Greater Washington](https://ggwash.org/drowlands).  

This site is a portfolio of projects I've created for [GES 687, "Advanced Applications of Geographic Information Systems,"](http://catalog.umbc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=17&coid=51285) at UMBC.

![bivariate local Moran's I analysis of race and gender in Baltimore](ClusterAnalysisLab/Bivariate_pF_pAA.JPG){: .align-left width="240px"}
A bivariate local Moran's I spatial correlation analysis map showing the high correlation between the fraction of African-American residents in neighborhoods and the fraction of female residents (a proxy for rates of incarceration of residents) in those same neighborhoods.  It was produced for Lab 6 in GES 687 during the Fall 2018 semester at UMBC.

#### [Population Distribution and Race](DC_Pop_Dist/DC_Pop_Dist.html)

![Map of population distribution, color-coded by race, for the DC metro area, 1970-2016](DC_Pop_Dist/Dotmaps-Large.gif){: .align-left width="240px"}
Map of the population distribution in the DC metro area, 1970-2016. One dot per ten residents, colored blue for whites, green for African-Americans, orange for Latinx, and red for Asian-Americans (and others). The large dots are the center-of-population for each racial group within the study region.  It was produced for Project 2 in GES 687 during the Fall 2018 semester at UMBC.

#### [Property Values and Transit](Baltimore-Property-Values-and-Transit/Baltimore-Property-Values-and-Transit.html)

![3D map of of Baltimore City showing distance from transit as elevation and property values by color](Baltimore-Property-Values-and-Transit/3D-Map.png){: .align-left width="240px"}
This 3D map of of Baltimore City shows distance from transit as elevation and value per square meter of private real property as color, with bluer colors indicating higher values. It was produced for Project 1 in GES 687 during the Fall 2018 semester at UMBC.
