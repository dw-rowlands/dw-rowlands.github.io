## Welcome to my GES 687 Portfolio

![My photo](DWRowlands-Headshot.jpg){: .align-left width="120px"}
My name is DW Rowlands.  I am a visiting lecturer in chemistry at the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://www.umbc.edu) and I write about urban planning, transportation, and local history topics for [Greater Greater Washington](https://ggwash.org/drowlands).  

This site is a portfolio of projects I've created for [GES 687, "Advanced Applications of Geographic Information Systems,"](http://catalog.umbc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=17&coid=51285) at UMBC.

I made this map of [Census-designated places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census-designated_place) and municipalities in the DC area for [a Greater Greater Washington article](https://ggwash.org/view/63487/where-you-live-is-important-but-around-here-its-not-that-easy-to-define).
