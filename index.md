## Welcome to my GES 687 Portfolio

![My photo](DWRowlands-Headshot.jpg){: .align-left width="120px"}
My name is DW Rowlands.  I am a visiting lecturer in chemistry at the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://www.umbc.edu) and I write about urban planning, transportation, and local history topics for [Greater Greater Washington](https://ggwash.org/drowlands).  

This site is a portfolio of projects I've created for [GES 687, "Advanced Applications of Geographic Information Systems,"](http://catalog.umbc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=17&coid=51285) at UMBC.

![3D map of of Baltimore City showing distance from transit as elevation and property values by color](Baltimore-Property-Values-and-Transit/3D-Map.png){: .align-left width="240px"}
A 3D map of of Baltimore City. Elevation represents distance from a frequent transit stop and is 1:1 with horizontal distance. Color represents value per square meter of private real property lots, with bluer colors indicating higher values. This map was produced for Project 1 in GES 687 during the Fall 2018 semester at UMBC.
